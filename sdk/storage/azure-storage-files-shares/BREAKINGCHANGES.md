# Release History

## 1.0.0-beta.3 (2020-10-13)

* CreateFromConnectionString now accepts unencoded file and directory name.
* Added support for getting range list with previous snapshot. `GetFileRangeListResult` now returns `std::vector<FileRange> Ranges` and `std::vector<FileRange> ClearRanges` instead of `std::vector<Range> RangeList`.
* Added support for SMB Multi-Channel setting for `ServiceClient::GetProperties` and `ServiceClient::SetProperties`. This is only available for Storage account with Premium File access.
  - Standard account user has to remove the returned SMB Multi-Channel setting before set, otherwise service would return failure.
