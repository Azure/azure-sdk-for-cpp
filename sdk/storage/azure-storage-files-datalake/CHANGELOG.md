- Rename APIs now return the client of the resource it is renaming to.
- Removed `Mode` for rename operations' options, that originally controls the rename mode. Now it is fixed to legacy mode.
- Changed `SetAccessControlRecursive` to `SetAccessControlRecursiveListSinglePage`, to mark that it is a single page operation, and removed the `mode` parameter, separated the modify/delete functionality to two new APIs.
- Moved `SetAccessControlRecursiveListSinglePage` to `DataLakePathClient`.
