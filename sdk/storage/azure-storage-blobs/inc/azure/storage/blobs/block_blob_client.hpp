   * @brief The BlockBlobClient allows you to manipulate Azure Storage block blobs.
   *
   * Block blobs let you upload large blobs efficiently. Block blobs are comprised of blocks, each
   * of which is identified by a block ID. You create or modify a block blob by writing a set of
   * blocks and committing them by their block IDs. Each block can be a different size.
   *
   * When you upload a block to a blob in your storage account, it is associated with the specified
   * block blob, but it does not become part of the blob until you commit a list of blocks that
   * includes the new block's ID. New blocks remain in an uncommitted state until they are
   * specifically committed or discarded. Writing a block does not update the last modified time of
   * an existing blob.
