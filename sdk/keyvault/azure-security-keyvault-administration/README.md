# Azure Security KeyVault Administration client library for C++

Azure Key Vault Managed HSM is a fully-managed, highly-available, single-tenant, standards-compliant cloud service that enables you to safeguard
cryptographic keys for your cloud applications using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs.

Azure Security Keyvault Administration Package client library for C++ (`azure-security-keyvault-administration`) matches necessary patterns that the development team has established to create a unified SDK written in the C++ programming language. These libraries follow the Azure SDK Design Guidelines for C++.

The library allows client libraries to expose common functionality in a consistent fashion.  Once you learn how to use these APIs in one client library, you will know how to use them in other client libraries.

## Getting started

### Install the package
Install the Azure Key Vault Administration Setting client library for C++ with vcpkg:

```cmd
vcpkg install azure-security-keyvault-administration-cpp
```

### Prerequisites

* An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].
* An existing Azure Key Vault. If you need to create an Azure Key Vault, you can use the [Azure CLI][azure_cli].
* Authorization to an existing Azure Key Vault using either [RBAC][rbac_guide] (recommended) or [access control][access_policy].

To create a Managed HSM resource, run the following CLI command:

```PowerShell
az keyvault create --hsm-name <your-key-vault-name> --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --administrators <your-user-object-id> --location <your-azure-location>
```

To get `<your-user-object-id>` you can run the following CLI command:

```PowerShell
az ad user show --id <your-user-principal> --query id
```

#### Activate your managed HSM

All data plane commands are disabled until the HSM is activated. You will not be able to create keys or assign roles.
Only the designated administrators that were assigned during the create command can activate the HSM. To activate the HSM you must download the security domain.

To activate your HSM you need:

* A minimum of 3 RSA key-pairs (maximum 10)
* Specify the minimum number of keys required to decrypt the security domain (quorum)

To activate the HSM you send at least 3 (maximum 10) RSA public keys to the HSM. The HSM encrypts the security domain with these keys and sends it back.
Once this security domain is successfully downloaded, your HSM is ready to use.
You also need to specify quorum, which is the minimum number of private keys required to decrypt the security domain.

The example below shows how to use openssl to generate 3 self-signed certificates.

```PowerShell
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout cert_0.key -x509 -days 365 -out cert_0.cer
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout cert_1.key -x509 -days 365 -out cert_1.cer
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout cert_2.key -x509 -days 365 -out cert_2.cer
```

Use the `az keyvault security-domain download` command to download the security domain and activate your managed HSM.
The example below uses 3 RSA key pairs (only public keys are needed for this command) and sets the quorum to 2.

```PowerShell
az keyvault security-domain download --hsm-name <your-managed-hsm-name> --sd-wrapping-keys ./certs/cert_0.cer ./certs/cert_1.cer ./certs/cert_2.cer --sd-quorum 2 --security-domain-file ContosoMHSM-SD.json
```

#### Controlling access to your managed HSM

The designated administrators assigned during creation are automatically added to the "Managed HSM Administrators" [built-in role][built_in_roles],
who are able to download a security domain and [manage roles for data plane access][access_control], among other limited permissions.

To perform other actions on keys, you need to assign principals to other roles such as "Managed HSM Crypto User", which can perform non-destructive key operations:

```PowerShell
az keyvault role assignment create --hsm-name <your-managed-hsm-name> --role "Managed HSM Crypto User" --scope / --assignee-object-id <principal-or-user-object-ID> --assignee-principal-type <principal-type>
```

Please read [best practices][best_practices] for properly securing your managed HSM.

## Key Concepts
### Thread safety
We guarantee that all client instance methods are thread-safe and independent of each other ([guideline](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/cpp_introduction.html#thread-safety)). This ensures that the recommendation of reusing client instances is always safe, even across threads.

## Examples 

For detailed samples please review the code provided. 

### GetSettings 

To get all the available settings present on the Keyvault instance we will first create a client : 
```cpp
  auto tenantId = std::getenv("AZURE_TENANT_ID");
  auto clientId = std::getenv("AZURE_CLIENT_ID");
  auto clientSecret = std::getenv("AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET");
  auto credential
      = std::make_shared<Azure::Identity::ClientSecretCredential>(tenantId, clientId, clientSecret);

  // create client
  SettingsClient settingsClient(std::getenv("AZURE_KEYVAULT_HSM_URL"), credential);
```
Please note that we are using the HSM URL, not the keyvault URL. 

To get the settings we will call the GetSettings API 

```cpp
  // Get all settings
  SettingsListResult settingsList = settingsClient.GetSettings().Value;
```

### GetSetting

To get a specific setting we will call the GetSetting API bassing the setting name as a string parameter. 

```cpp
  Setting setting = settingsClient.GetSetting(settingsList.Value[0].Name).Value;
```

### UpdateSetting

To update the value of any of the the available settings, we will call the UpdateSettings API as follows:
```cpp
 UpdateSettingOptions options;
 options.Value = <setting value>;

Setting updatedSetting
   = settingsClient.UpdateSetting(settingsList.Value[0].Name, options).Value;
```
