# Azure Security Keyvault Administration Package client library for C++

Azure Security Keyvault Administration Package client library for C++ (`azure-security-keyvault-administration`) matches necessary patterns that the development team has established to create a unified SDK written in the C++ programming language. These libraries follow the Azure SDK Design Guidelines for C++.

The library allows client libraries to expose common functionality in a consistent fashion.  Once you learn how to use these APIs in one client library, you will know how to use them in other client libraries.
