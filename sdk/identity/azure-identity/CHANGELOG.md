# Release History

## 1.7.0-beta.1 (Unreleased)

### Features Added

- [[#5116]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/issues/5116) `AzureCliCredential`: Added support for the new response field which represents token expiration timestamp as time zone agnostic value.

### Breaking Changes

### Bugs Fixed

- [[#5075]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/issues/5075) `AzureCliCredential` assumes token expiration time without local time zone adjustment.

### Other Changes

- [[#5141]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/issues/5141) Added error response details to the `AuthenticationException` thrown when the authority host returns error response.

## 1.6.0 (2023-11-10)

### Features Added

- Added `WorkloadIdentityCredential`.
- When one of the credentials within `DefaultAzureCredential` is successful, it gets re-used during all subsequent attempts to get the token.
- Updated `ClientSecretCredentialOptions` and `ClientCertificateCredentialOptions` to read the default value for the authority host option from the environment variable first.

### Breaking Changes

- Add `WorkloadIdentityCredential` to the `DefaultAzureCredential`.

### Bugs Fixed

- Do not throw an exception during `AzureCliCredential` construction, but rather delay it to the `GetToken()` call.
- Harden checks for the tenant ID.
- Disallow space character when validating tenant id and scopes as input for `AzureCliCredential`.
- Add authority host url validation to reject non-HTTPS schemes.
- [[#4084]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/issues/4084) Remove OpenSSL dependency on Windows. (A community contribution, courtesy of _[teo-tsirpanis](https://github.com/teo-tsirpanis)_)

### Other Changes

- Add default values to some `WorkloadIdentityCredentialOptions` fields such as authority host by reading them from the environment.
- Add logging to `WorkloadIdentityCredential` to help with debugging.
- Create separate lists of characters that are allowed within tenant ids and scopes in `AzureCliCredential`.
