# Azure SDK Perf for C++

Azure perf for C++ (`azure-perf`) provides shared primitives, abstractions, and helpers for running performance tests for an Azure SDK clients for C++. It represent the C++ version of the [.NET original version](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/common/Perf).

## Getting started

See the [pre-requisites](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pre-requisites) for building before going to the next step.

### Build

Use the build option `BUILD_PERFORMANCE_TESTS` to build the test framework and all the performance tests. See the next example.

```bash
#
# Building the Performance framework and tests.
#
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp.git
cd azure-sdk-for-cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DBUILD_PERFORMANCE_TESTS=ON ..
cmake --build .
```

### Run

Once building is completed, a performance test application will be created inside the the test folder from each service SDK. For instance, the Azure core performance test application would be inside: `build/sdk/core/azure-core/test/perf`. See next example for running the performance framework.

```bash
#
# Running the performance framework tests application
#
# From within the build folder (build)
./sdk/core/perf/test/azure-perf-test
```

>Note: When building the code with Windows using Visual Studio, use the [CMake project view](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=msvc-160) to run the performance tests. Find the tests directly in the tests folder from the cmake tree next to all other test cmake projects.

#### Options for running

After running the performance test application like it is mentioned above (without any command line arguments) the application will list the available test names to be run. The application will expect the test name to be executed as a mandatory argument. If the input test name is not found, the application will return an error and will terminate. The next pattern represents the right usage of the performance test application:
```bash
usage: azure-perf-test testName [options]
```

>Note: You can use the option `-h` to print out the available options for a test name.

The next options can be used for any test:
| Option     | Activators | Description | Default | Example |
| ---------- | ---        | ---| ---| --- |
| Duration   | -d, --duration   | Duration of the test in seconds                  | 10    | -d 5
| Host       | --host           | Host to redirect HTTP requests                   | NA    | --host=https://something.com
| Insecure   | --insecure       | Allow untrusted SSL certs                        | false | --insecure=true
| Iterations | -i, --iterations | Number of iterations of main test loop           | 1     | -d 5
| Statistics | --statistics     | Print job statistics                             | false | --statistics=true
| Latency    | -l, --latency    | Track and print per-operation latency statistics | false | -l true
| No Clean   | --noclean        | Disables test clean up                           | false | --nocleanup=true
| Parallel   | -p, --parallel   | Number of operations to execute in parallel      | 1     | -p 5
| Port       | --port           | Port to redirect HTTP requests                   | NA    | --port=5000
| Rate       | -r, --rate       | Target throughput (ops/sec)                      | NA    | -r 3000
| Warm up    | -w, --warmup     | Duration of warmup in seconds                    | 5     | -w 0 (no warm up)

## Creating a perf test

Find below how to create a new CMake performance test project from scratch to an existing CMake project. Then how to add the performance tests to it.

### The CMake project

The main CMake project represents the definition of the main performance test application. It defines the name of the binary to be produced and the libraries to be linked to it. The recommended folder where this project should be is inside the `test` folder from a service package (i.e. sdk/core/azure-core/test/performance).

Follow the next template to create the main CMake project
```cmake
# Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

# Configure CMake project.
cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.13)
project(provide-a-project-name-here LANGUAGES CXX)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)

# Name the binary to be created.
add_executable (
  azure-performance-library-name-test
    src/main.cpp
)

# Include the headers from the project.
target_include_directories(
  azure-performance-library-name-test
    PUBLIC
    $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/inc>
)

# link the `azure-perf` lib together with any other library which will be used for the tests. Below example is using azure-core only.
target_link_libraries(azure-performance-library-name-test PRIVATE azure-core azure-perf)
# Make sure the project will appear in the test folder for Visual Studio CMake view
set_target_properties(azure-performance-library-name-test PROPERTIES FOLDER "Tests")

```

> Notes:
>- Create the `src` and `inc` folders.
>- Add a `main.cpp` file to the `src` folder.

### The `main.cpp`

The main source file defines the list of available tests and calls the performance framework `Run` function. Take a loop to the next example.

```cpp
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

// The performance framework headers
#include <azure/perf/options.hpp>
#include <azure/perf/program.hpp>

// The test definition headers
#include "azure/perf/test/extended_options.hpp"
#include "azure/perf/test/no_op_test.hpp"

// The utilities
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{

  /**
   * The test list is a dictionary with the name of the test as a key and
   * an std::function to define how to instantiate a new Test for the PerfTest
   * interface.
   *
   * In the next example, a map called `tests` is init with two test definitions.
   *
   **/
  std::map<
      std::string,
      std::function<std::unique_ptr<Azure::Perf::PerfTest>(
          Azure::Perf::TestOptions)>>
      tests{
          {"noOp", // Test Name
           [](Azure::Perf::TestOptions options) {
             // No Op test
             return std::make_unique<Azure::Perf::Test::NoOp>(options);
           }},
          {"extendedOptions", // Test Name
            [](Azure::Perf::TestOptions options) {
             // Extended options test
             return std::make_unique<Azure::Perf::Test::ExtendedOptionsTest>(options);
           }}};

  // Call the `Run` method with a context, the tests and the application arguments to launch the program.
  Azure::Perf::Program::Run(Azure::Core::Context::ApplicationContext, tests, argc, argv);

  return 0;
}

```

The `Run` method from the performance framework will parse the command line arguments to find out the test name to be run. Then it will try to get that test name from the `tests` map. If the test is found, the framework will get any extra options defined in the test and parse it from the command line arguments. Then it uses the `std::function` to create a as many instances of the test as the `parallel` option value.

In the above code example, the two tests added to the `map` are defined in the project headers. Each test is defined in its own header. See below example for how to define a test.

### Create a performance test

The next code example illustrates how to define a very simple empty test.

```cpp
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

/**
 * @file
 * @brief Define an empty test.
 *
 */

#pragma once

// The performance framework headers
#include <azure/perf/options.hpp>
#include <azure/perf/test.hpp>

// Use a namespace according to the service package
namespace Azure { namespace Perf { namespace Test {

  // Define a derived class from a PerfTest
  class NoOp : public Azure::Perf::PerfTest {
  public:

    // Define a constructor to take TestOptions and use the options for the
    // PerfTest constructor.
    NoOp(Azure::Perf::TestOptions options) : PerfTest(options) {}

    // Override the `Run` method with the test definition
    void Run(Azure::Core::Context const& ctx) override {
      (void)ctx;
    }
  };

}}} // namespace Azure::Perf::Test

```

### Create a performance test with options

A test can define its own options as an addition to the base options from the performance framework. See the next example to learn how to do it.

```cpp
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

/**
 * @file
 * @brief An example of a performance test that defines a test option.
 *
 */

#pragma once

// The performance framework headers
#include <azure/perf/options.hpp>
#include <azure/perf/test.hpp>
#include <azure/perf/test_options.hpp>

// Utilities
#include <vector>

namespace Azure { namespace Perf { namespace Test {

  // The test class definition and constructor looks just the same as any
  // other test (with or without extended options).
  class ExtendedOptionsTest : public Azure::Perf::PerfTest {
  public:

    ExtendedOptionsTest(Azure::Perf::TestOptions options) : PerfTest(options) {}

    // Override the `GetTestOptions` function to define the unique test options.
    // Do not duplicate activators or test names or the application will fail during parsing.
    std::vector<Azure::Perf::TestOption> GetTestOptions() override
    {
      // Each test option is define by 4 properties:
      // - Name (string)
      // - Activators (array of strings which must starts with `-` or `--`)
      // - Description (string that will be use for the help message on console)
      // - Expected Arguments (int to define how many arguments are expected after the activator)
      return {{"extraOption", {"-e"}, "Example for extended option for test.", 1}};
    }

    // Use the `m_options.GetOptionsOrDefault` function inside the test definition to get
    // the test options.
    void Run(Azure::Core::Context const& ctx) override
    {
      // Get a defined test option.
      auto myTestOption = m_options.GetOptionOrDefault("extraOption", 0);
      (void)ctx;
      (void)myTestOption;
    }
  };

}}} // namespace Azure::Perf::Test

```
