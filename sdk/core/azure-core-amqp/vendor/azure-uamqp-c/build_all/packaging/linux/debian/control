Architecture: any
Depends: azure-uamqp-c-lib (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}, azure-c-shared-util-dev
Description: uAMQP is a general purpose C library for AMQP.
 The goal is to be as compliant with the standard as possible while 
 optimizing for low RAM footprint and also being portable.  It is 
 currently a client side implementation only. Although much of the 
 standardis symmetrical, there are parts that are asymmetrical,
 like the SASL handshake. Currently uAMQP does not provide the
 server side for these asymmetrical protions of the ISO.
