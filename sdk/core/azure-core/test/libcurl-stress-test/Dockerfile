# During CMake generate step VCPKG runs in manifest mode, as such it will sync the packages to the level 
# of the hash specified in src/azure-sdk-for-cpp/cmake-modules/AzureVcpkg.cmake in the VCPKG_COMMIT_STRING
# environment variable thus the packages we run with are not the latest versions but the ones the code
# was developed against. If the builtin-baseline is specified in the vcpkg file then that is the top most
# version of the packages that will be fetched.
# So when building from root we need to match the two values. When not building from root if the vcpkg file
# does not specify a baseline the value set in the cmake file will ensure that we are at the desired level.
