# Azure SDK Core Library for C++

Azure::Core (`azure-core`) provides shared primitives, abstractions, and helpers for modern Azure SDK client libraries written in the C++. These libraries follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for C++][azure_sdk_cpp_development_guidelines].

The library allows client libraries to expose common functionality in a consistent fashion.  Once you learn how to use these APIs in one client library, you will know how to use them in other client libraries.

## Getting started

Typically, you will not need to download `azure-core`; it will be downloaded for you as a dependency of the client libraries.  In case you want to download it explicitly (to implement your own client library, for example), you can find the source
in here.

## Key concepts

The main shared concepts of Azure::Core include:
- Configuring service cliesnt, e.g. configuring retries, logging, etc.. (`ClientOptions`)
- Accessing HTTP response details (`Response`, `Response<T>`)
- Polling long-running operations
- Exceptions for reporting errors from service requests in a consistent fashion (`RequestFailedException`)
- Abstractions for Azure SDK Credentials (`TokenCredential`)

### HTTP Transport adapter

Out of the box, the Azure SDK for C++ supports the libcurl and WinHTTP libraries as HTTP stacks for communicating with Azure services over the network. The SDK also provides a mechanism for `customer-implemented` *HTTP transport adapter*.

## Troubleshooting

Three main ways of troubleshooting failures are:
- Inspecting exceptions
- Enabling logging (`Available in future release`)
- Distributed tracing (`Available in future release`)

## Next steps

Explore and install available Azure SDK libraries.
