## 1.8.1 (2023-04-06)

### Bugs Fixed

- [[#4213]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/issues/4213) Fixed a bug where `Host` request header is not set for non-default port (80, 443).
- [[#4443]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/issues/4443) Fixed potentially high CPU usage on Windows.

### Other Changes

- Libcurl transport doesn't add `Content-Length` request header for GET/HEAD/DELETE requests anymore.

## 1.8.0 (2023-02-02)

### Features Added

- Added support for parsing space character in place of 'T' in RFC3339 DateTimes.
- Added support for HTTP proxy servers, both unauthenticated and with basic authentication.
- Added universal support for several TLS options:
  - Added the ability to set the expected TLS root certificate for TLS connection (useful if a proxy server uses a TLS certificate that is not chained to a known root).
  - Added the ability to enable TLS certificate revocation list checks (off by default).
    - For libcurl only: Allow TLS connection to succeed if CRL retrieval fails.
    - *NOTE*: This change only applies if libcurl is built using the OpenSSL crypto backend. It does NOT apply if libcurl uses the schannel (Windows default) or SecureTransport (macOS/iOS default).

### Breaking Changes

- Changed the name of several distributed tracing HTTP span attributes:
  - `requestId` is renamed to `az.client_request_id`
  - `serviceRequestId` is renamed to `az.service_request_id`

- Bearer token authentication will not work for endpoint URL protocol schemes other than `"https"`. This ensures token security and is consistent with the Azure SDKs for other languages.

- Removed `noexcept` specification from `Azure::DateTime::clock::now()`.

- Updated retry policy timeouts to conform to Azure guidelines.
  - The default delay between retries is changed from 4 seconds to 800ms.
  - The maximum retry delay is changed from 2 minutes to 60 seconds (one minute).

  If the original behavior is desired, customers can adjust these timeouts by changing the `RetryDelay` and `MaxRetryDelay` fields in the `RetryOptions` structure.

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed bug in WinHTTP client which caused the `IgnoreUnknownCertificateAuthority` and `EnableCertificateRevocationListCheck` fields to be ignored if they were passed in from `TransportOptions`.
- [[#4206]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/issues/4206) Fixed connectivity issues in libcurl HTTP transport which can occur if a TCP connection is dropped prematurely. (A community contribution, courtesy of _[ahojnnes](https://github.com/ahojnnes)_)

### Other Changes

- Update distributed tracing attributes to align with current Azure Distributed Tracing Conventions attributes and names.
- Added the ability to consume version 1.1.1n of OpenSSL.
- Added support for Identity token caching, and for configuring token refresh offset in `BearerTokenAuthenticationPolicy`.
- Improved cancellation support for WinHTTP transport.

## 1.0.0-beta.4 (2021-01-13)

### New Features

- Added a WinHTTP-based `HttpTransport` called `WinHttpTransport` and use that as the default `TransportPolicyOptions.Transport` on Windows when sending and receiving requests and responses over the wire.
- Added `Range` type to `Azure::Core::Http` namespace.
- Added support for long-running operations with `Operation<T>`.
- Added support for setting a custom transport adapter by implementing the method `std::shared_ptr<HttpTransport> ::AzureSdkGetCustomHttpTransport()`.
- Added interoperability between `std::chrono::system_clock` types and `DateTime`.
- Added default constructor to `DateTime` and support for dates since 0001.
- Added Base64 encoding and decoding utility APIs to the `Azure::Core` namespace available from `azure/core/base64.hpp`.
- Added `Http::Response<void>` template specialization.
- Added `GetHeadersAsString()` on the `Azure::Core::Http::Request` class.
- Added a `platform.hpp` header file for defining commonly used OS-specific `#define` constants.
- Added `IsCancelled()` on the `Azure::Core::Context` class.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `DateTime::operator Duration()`, `DateTime::Duration` typedef and `DateTime::Now()`.
- Moved `Azure::Core::BearerTokenAuthenticationPolicy`, defined in `azure/core/credentials.hpp` to `Azure::Core::Http` namespace in `azure/core/http/policy.hpp` header.
- Changed type of `Token::ExpiresOn` to `DateTime`.
- Renamed exception `OperationCanceledException` to `OperationCancelledException` and `ThrowIfCanceled()` to `ThrowIfCancelled()` on the `Context` class.
- Moved `Azure::Core::Version`, defined in `azure/core/version.hpp` to the `Azure::Core::Details` namespace.
- Changed `Azure::Core::AuthenticationException` to derive from `std::exception` instead of `std::runtime_error`.
- Changed the `BodyStream::Read` API from being a pure virtual function to non-virtual.
- Removed `CurlConnection`, `CurlConnectionPool`, `CurlSession`, and `CurlNetworkConnection` by making headers meant as implementation, private.
- Removed option `AllowBeast` from `CurlTransportSSLOptions` in `CurlTransportOptions`.
- Changed default option `NoRevoke` from `CurlTransportSSLOptions` for the `CurlTransportOptions` to `true`. This disables the revocation list checking by default.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the Curl transport adapter connection pooling when setting options.
- Fixed setting up the default transport adapter.
- Fixed linker error of missing pthread on Linux.
- Initialize class data members to avoid MSVC warning.
- Throw `Azure::Core::Http::TransportException` if `curl_easy_init()` returns a null handle. (A community contribution, courtesy of _[ku-sourav](https://github.com/ku-sourav)_)

### Other Changes and Improvements

- Added support for distributing the C++ SDK as a source package via vcpkg.
- Fixed installation error when the SDK is being installed under a non-standard prefix. (A community contribution, courtesy of _[juchem](https://github.com/juchem)_)
- Fixed linker error when pthread is missing on Linux. (A community contribution, courtesy of _[lordgamez](https://github.com/lordgamez)_)

## 1.0.0-beta.3 (2020-11-11)

### New Features

- Added `strings.hpp` with `Azure::Core::Strings::LocaleInvariantCaseInsensitiveEqual` and `Azure::Core::Strings::ToLower`.
- Added `GetPort()` to `Url`.
- Added `TransportPolicyOptions`.
- Added `TelemetryPolicyOptions`.
- Added `RequestFailedException` deriving from `std::runtime_error`.
- Added `CurlTransportOptions` for the `CurlTransport`.
- Added `DateTime` supporting dates since 1601.
- Added `OperationCanceledException`.
- Added `Encode` and `Decode` to `Url`.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `azure.hpp`.
- Removed macro `AZURE_UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER`.
- Bump CMake version from 3.12 to 3.13.
- Bump libcurl version from 7.4 to 7.44.
- Moved `ClientSecretCredential` and `EnvironmentCredential` to the Identity library.
- `Url` class changes:
  - `AppendPath` now does not encode the input by default.
  - Signature updated for `SetHost`, `SetPath` and `AppendPath`.
  - Removed `SetFragment`.
  - Renamed `AppendQueries` to `AppendQueryParameters`.
  - Renamed `AppendQuery` to `AppendQueryParameter`.
  - Renamed `RemoveQuery` to `RemoveQueryParameter`.
  - Renamed `GetQuery` to `GetQueryParameters`.

### Bug Fixes

- Prevent pipeline of length zero to be created.
- Avoid re-using a connection when a request to upload data fails while using the `CurlTransport`.
- Add entropy to `Uuid` generation.

### Other Changes and Improvements

- Add high-level and simplified core.hpp file for simpler include experience for customers.
- Add code coverage using gcov with gcc.
- Update SDK-defined exception types to be classes instead of structs.
- Updated `TransportException` and `InvalidHeaderException` to derive from `RequestFailedException`.
- Vcpkg dependency version updated to 2020.11.
- Make libcurl network requests cancelable by Context::Cancel().
- Validate HTTP headers for invalid characters.
- Calling `Cancel()` from context now throws `OperationCanceledException`.

## 1.0.0-beta.2 (2020-10-09)

### Breaking Changes

- Throw Azure::Http::TransportException if creating new connection fails.
- Response objects store Nullable\<T\>.

### Bug Fixes

- Switched to a more stable wait on sockets to address connection timeouts.
- Replace `Nullable(const T&)` with `Nullable(T)` to avoid extra copy when initialized with an rvalue.

### Other Changes and Improvements

- Improved performance on windows when using libcurl.
- Pinned the version of package dependencies.
- Added NOTICE.txt for 3rd party dependencies.
- Added build instructions for running tests. (A community contribution, courtesy of _[ku-sourav](https://github.com/ku-sourav)_)
