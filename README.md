# Azure SDK for C++

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_apis/build/status/cpp/cpp%20-%20client%20-%20ci?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_build/latest?definitionId=1611&branchName=master)

This repository is for active development of the Azure SDK for C++. For consumers of the SDK we recommend visiting our [developer docs](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-cpp).

## Getting started

For the best development experience, we recommend developers use [CMake projects in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019) to view and build the source code together with its dependencies. You can also use any other text editor of your choice, such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), along with the command line for building your application with the SDK.

You can find additional information for specific libraries by navigating to the appropriate folder in the `/sdk` directory. See the **README.md** file located in the library's project folder, for example, the [Azure Storage client library](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/tree/master/sdk/storage#azure-storage-client-library-for-c).

For API reference docs, tutorials, samples, quick starts, and other documentation, go to [Azure SDK for C++ Developer Docs](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-cpp).

### Download & Install the SDK

The easiest way to acquire the C++ SDK is leveraging vcpkg package manager. You will need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) before getting started.

First clone and bootstrap vcpkg itself. You can install it anywhere on your machine, but **make note** of the directory where you clone the vcpkg repo.

```cmd
> git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
```

On Windows:

```cmd
> .\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```

On Linux:

```sh
> ./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
```

To install the libraries for your project, run the following, optionally specifying the triplet. For example, the following will install packages for the `x64-windows` triplet. On Windows, not specifying a triplet will default to `x86-windows`:

```cmd
> .\vcpkg\vcpkg install azure-storage-blobs-cpp:x64-windows
```

See the [list of packages](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp#vcpkg) available via vcpkg below. All Azure C++ SDK package names start with `azure-`. You can also search for the libraries you need with the `search` command. For example:

```cmd
> .\vcpkg\vcpkg search azure-
```

Once the library is installed, follow the instructions from the console output to include the library in your `CMake` application. For example, to include `azure-storage-blobs-cpp`, add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```CMake
find_package(azure-storage-blobs-cpp CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myProject PRIVATE Azure::azure-storage-blobs)
```

> NOTE: All the Azure client libraries take a dependency on `azure-core-cpp` which provides functionality commonly needed by all Azure clients. When you install any client library via vcpkg, it will bring in all the necessary dependencies as well. You don't need to install those individually to get started.

You can reference this [vcpkg Quick Start](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start-windows) for more details.

### Building your Application

In order to use the SDK installed via vcpkg with CMake, you can use the toolchain file from vcpkg:

```cmd
> cmake -B [build directory] -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path to vcpkg repo]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
> cmake --build [build directory]
```

The **entry point** for most scenarios when using the SDK will be a top-level client type corresponding to the Azure service you want to talk to. For example, sending requests to blob storage can be done via the `Azure::Storage::Blobs::BlobClient` API.

All the Azure C++ SDK headers needed to be included are located within the `<azure>` folder, with sub-folders corresponding to each service. Similarly, all types and APIs can be found within the `Azure::` namespace. For example, to use functionality form `Azure::Core`, include the following header at the beginning of your application `#include <azure/core.hpp>`.

Here's an example application to help you get started:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <azure/core.hpp>
#include <azure/storage/blobs.hpp>

using namespace Azure::Storage::Blobs;

// Get the required connection string/key from an environment variable or Azure KeyVault.
std::string GetConnectionString();

int main()
{
  std::string containerName = "testcontainer";
  std::string blobName = "sample-blob";

  try
  {
    auto client = BlobClient::CreateFromConnectionString(
        GetConnectionString(), containerName, blobName);
  }
  catch (const Azure::Core::RequestFailedException& e)
  {
    std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

#### Visual Studio - CMakeSettings.json

When building your application via Visual Studio, you can create and update a `CMakeSettings.json` file and include the following properties to let Visual Studio know where the packages are installed and which triplet needs to be used:

```json
{
  "configurations": [
    {
        "cmakeToolchain": "<path to vcpkg repo>/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake",
        "variables": [
        {
          "name": "VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET",
          "value": "x64-windows",
          "type": "STRING"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Azure Requirements

To call Azure services, you must first have an Azure subscription. Sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) or use your [MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/).

## Packages available

Each service might have a number of libraries available. These libraries follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for C++](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/cpp_introduction.html) and share a number of core features such as HTTP retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, etc., so that once you learn how to use these features in one client library, you will know how to use them in other client libraries. You can learn about these shared features at [Azure::Core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/README.md).

The client libraries can be identified by the naming used for their folder, package, and namespace. Each will start with `azure`, followed by the service category, and then the name of the service. For example `azure-storage-blobs`.

For a complete list of available packages, please see the [latest available packages](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/#c) page.

> NOTE: If you need to ensure your code is ready for production we strongly recommend using one of the stable, non-beta libraries.

### Vcpkg

The following SDK library releases are available on [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg):

* `azure-core-cpp`
* `azure-identity-cpp`
* `azure-storage-blobs-cpp`
* `azure-storage-common-cpp`
* `azure-storage-files-datalake-cpp`
* `azure-storage-files-shares-cpp`

> NOTE: In case of getting linker errors when consuming the SDK on Windows, make sure that [vcpkg triplet](https://vcpkg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/triplets/) being consumed matches the [CRT link flags](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/reference/md-mt-ld-use-run-time-library?view=msvc-160) being set for your app or library build. See also `MSVC_USE_STATIC_CRT` build flag.

## Navigating the repository

### Master branch

The master branch has the most recent code with new features and bug fixes. It does **not** represent latest released **beta** or **GA** SDK.

### Release branches (Release tagging)

For each package we release there will be a unique git tag created that contains the name and the version of the package to mark the commit of the code that produced the package. This tag will be used for servicing via hotfix branches as well as debugging the code for a particular beta or stable release version.
Format of the release tags are `<package-name>_<package-version>`. For more information please see [our branching strategy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/master/docs/policies/repobranching.md#release-tagging).
